          <p>"Travel With" is a mobile app that connects tourists with trekking guides in Nepal. Built using React Native, Express.js, and MongoDB, it responds to a 2023 regulation requiring tourists to hire guides in protected areas. This project gave me hands-on experience in full-stack development.</p>

								  <h3 class="major">Creating a Virtual Memory Manager</h3>
								  <p>This project involved creating a simulator to translate logical addresses to physical ones using a Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB) and page table. It handled virtual memory of 65,536 bytes, resolved page faults via demand paging, and implemented a page-replacement algorithm. The program read logical addresses from a file and output the corresponding physical addresses and byte values.</p>

								  <p>Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with system-level memory management, reinforcing concepts from operating systems. It sharpened my problem-solving skills, improved my understanding of software design, and aligned directly with my goals to master system-level programming in computer science.</p>

									<h3 class="major">Restaurant Server System (Database Application)</h3>
									<p>For this project, I designed and implemented a restaurant server system backed by a relational database. It included creating an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD), defining a relational schema, populating the database, and building an interactive application to manage restaurant operations. The project involved working with SQL for data management and integrating it with an application (e.g., Java or Python) using proper authentication and access control.</p>
  
									<p>	This assignment strengthened my skills in database design, and data modeling. It aligned with my learning goals by deepening my understanding of software design principles, improving my system-level thinking, and enhancing my ability to solve real-world problems using structured data.

									<h3 class="major">Travel Application (React native application)</h3>
									<p>This was the senior capstone project for my degree. We were reuqired to submit a senior proplsal and work on it for 4 months.</p>
  
									<p>Created a mobile app to match tourists with local trekking guides, responding to a recent travel law in Nepal. Implemented core features like guide registration, tour posting, filtering by language, and booking requests. Emphasized self-learning and responsible AI use; used university coursework and LLMs to support development.</p>

									<h3 class="major">Web App for the Debate Coaches Assocaition in Django</h3>
									<p>This project involved creating a web based application for a real client, Utah debate coaches association, in collabortion with a 3 other developers and 4 desginers. </p>
  
									<p>Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with real world communcation in regards to figuring out client needs, teamwork and mangaement. I also got my first experience developing a full stack application here.</p>
								  </article>
								  <article>
									<h3 class="major">Creating a chatroom appliation with custom network protocol</h3>
									<p>This project required us to desgin a network protocol for a chatroom application amongst 5 of our teammates and implement a server client system so that each of our servers and clients could connect with each other.</p>
  
									<p>This project helped me develop a deeper understanding of network communication and protocol design, while also enhancing my ability to collaborate effectively in a team setting. </p>
